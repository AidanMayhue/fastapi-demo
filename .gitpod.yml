# Now we will start customizing our environment more.
# First we start with a custom Dockerfile that adds some software to Gitpod:
# image:
#     file: .gitpod.Dockerfile

# Then we add init tasks when the environment is started. First it installs our python
# dependencies as usual, but then also runs a redis DB container for us automatically.
# We will add more DBs to this as we move forward.
tasks:
  - init: pisp install -r requirements.txt
  - name: MySQL Client
    command: sudo apt install -y mysql-client

# We have also customized the environment so that whenever we run an app on port 8000 it
# is automatically made public and is opened up in a browser.
ports:
  - name: API
    description: Preview changes to your application
    port: 8000-9000
    onOpen: open-browser
    visibility: public
